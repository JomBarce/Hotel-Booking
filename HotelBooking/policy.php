		<h2>
			Scope and nature of our Service
		</h2>
		<p> 
			Through the Platform, we provide an online platform through which Hotels can advertise, market, promote and/or offer their products and service for reservation which relevant visitors of the Platform can discover, search, compare, and make a reservation or booking.
			By using or utilising the reservation service you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the Hotels in which you make a reservation or booking for their rooms.
			From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Hotels.
			We transmit the relevant details of your reservation to the Hotels and send you a  confirmation email for and 	on behalf of the Hotels. Hotel Booking does not (re)sell, rent out, offer any (travel) product or service.
		</p>
		<p>
			When rendering our Booking Service, the information that we disclose is based on the information provided to us by Hotels.
			As such, the Hotels that market and promote their offerings on the Platform are given access to our systems and extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates/fees/prices, availability, policies & conditions and other relevant information which is displayed on our Platform.
			Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our Booking Service, we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our Platform or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information.
			Each Hotels remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates/fees/prices, policies & conditions and availability) displayed on our Platform.
			Our Platform does not constitute and should not be regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating, type of accommodation of any Hotels (or its facilities, venue, vehicles, (main or ancillary) products or services) made available, save as explicitly indicated or set out otherwise.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Booking Service is made available for personal and non-commercial use only. 
			Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, reservations, tickets, products or services available on our Platform for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Free of charge for consumers, only Hotels pay!
		</h2>
		<p>
			Unless indicated otherwise, our service is free of charge for consumers because, unlike many other parties, we will not charge you for our Booking Service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the rate. 
			You will pay the Hotels the relevant amount as indicated in the Hotel Reservation (plus - insofar not included in the price – relevant applicable taxes, levies and fees (if applicable)).
		</p>
		<p>
			Hotels pay a commission (being a small percentage of the product price (e.g. room price)) to Hotel Booking after the end user has consummated the service or product of the Hotels (e.g. after the guest has stayed at (and paid) the accommodation). 
			Hotels can improve their ranking by increasing their commission (Visibility Booster). The use of the Visibility Booster (by increasing the commission in return for better position in the ranking) is at each Hotels's discretion and may be used from time to time and product to product offered. 
			The algorithm of the ranking will take an increase in commission into account when determining the Default Ranking. 
			Preferred partners pay a higher commission in return for a better position in the ranking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Only Hotels which have a commercial relationship with Hotel Booking (through an agreement) will be made available on Platform (for their B2B and/or B2C promotion of their product). Hotel Booking is not an open platform (like Amazon or eBay) where end users can make their product available (no C2C platform); Hotel Booking does not allow non-professional parties to offer or sell their products on or through Hotel Booking.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Pre-payment, cancellation, no-show and fine print
		</h2>
		<p>
			By making a Hotel Reservation with a Hotel, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Hotel, and to any additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the Hotels that may apply to your Trip (including the fine print of the Hotels made available on our Platform and the relevant house rules of the Hotels), including for services rendered and/or products offered by the Hotels.
			The relevant (delivery/purchase/use/carrier) terms and conditions of a Hotel can be obtained with the relevant Hotel. 
			The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Hotel is made available on our Platform on the Hotel information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (if applicable). 
			Please note that certain rates, fees or special offers are not eligible for cancellation, refund or change. Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Hotels in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. 
			Please check the (reservation) details of your product or service of choice thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. 
			Please note that a Hotel Reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may be cancelled (without a prior notice of default or warning) insofar the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant due or payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Hotels and the reservation. 
			Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary per segment, product or service of each Trip. 
			Please carefully read the fine print (below the Trip types or at the bottom of each Hotel page on our Platform) and important information in your reservation confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the Hotels (e.g. in respect of age requirement, security deposit, non-cancellation/additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds/no free breakfast, pets/cards accepted). Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Trip Provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.

			What kind of personal data does Hotel Booking collect?
		</h2>
		<p> 
			We can’t help you book the perfect Trip without information, so when you use our services there are certain things we ask for. 
			This is typically routine information – your name, preferred contact details, the names of the people travelling with you and your payment information. 
			You might also decide to submit additional information related to your upcoming Trip (for example, your anticipated arrival time).
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to this, we also collect information from the computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access our services. The browser you’re using and your language settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from others or when we automatically collect other information.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			Why does Hotel Booking collect and use your personal data?
		</h2>
		<p> 
			The main reason we ask you for personal details is to help you organise your online Hotel Reservations and ensure you get the best service possible.
			We also use your personal data to contact you about the latest deals, special offers and other products or services we think you might be interested in. 
			There are other uses, too. If you’d like to find out what they are, read on for a more detailed explanation.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>
			How does Hotel Booking share your data with third parties?
		</h2>
		<p> 
			There are different parties integrated into our services, in various ways and for various reasons. 
			The primary reason we share your data is to supply the Hotels with the relevant information to complete your Hotel Reservation.
			We also involve other parties to provide you with the Hotel Booking services.
		 	This includes, for example, financial institutions, advertisers, subsidiaries of Hotel Booking corporate group and other affiliates. Or, in some cases, if we’re required to by law, we might share your data with governmental or other authorities.

		<h2>
			What kind of personal data does Hotel Booking collect?
		</h2>
		<b>
		<p> 
			Personal data you give to us:
		</p>
		</b>
		<p>
			Hotel Booking collects and uses information you provide to us. When you make a Hotel Reservation, you are (at a minimum) asked for your name and email address.
			Depending on the Hotel Reservation, we may also ask for your home address, phone number, date of birth, the names of the people travelling with you and any preferences you might have for your Trip (such as dietary or accessibility requirements).
			If you need to get in touch with our customer service team, contact your Hotels through us, or reach out to us in a different way (such as social media) we’ll collect information from you there, too. 
			This applies whether you are contacting us with feedback or asking for help using our services.
			There are other instances where you’ll provide us with information, as well. 
			For example, if you’re browsing with your mobile device, you can decide to allow Hotel Booking to see your current location or grant us access to your contacts. 
			This helps us to give you the best possible service and experience by, for example, showing you our city guides, suggesting the nearest restaurants or attractions to your location or making other recommendations.
			If you create a user account, we’ll also store your personal settings, uploaded photos, and reviews of previous bookings. 
			This saved data can be used to help you plan and manage future Hotel Reservations or benefit from other features only available to account holders (such as incentives or other benefits).
